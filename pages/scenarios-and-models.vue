    <p>Scenario assumptions – as offered by the SSP-RCP framework – give us still very limited information about the possible futures. To see how the scenarios play out integrated assessment models and climate impact models come in.</p>

    <h3 id="integrated-assessment-models">Integrated Assessment Models</h3>

    <p>Integrated assessment models (IAMs) describe how socioeconomics relate to land &amp; energy use and how that relates to emissions.</p>

    <p>Here is a very simple example of such a model. As you can see…</p>

    <p>For every SSP there is a Marker-Model. This graphic shows indicators which are considered by those five models. We also had indicators like GDP and population growth in our simplified model, but energy types are split further down into actual energy sources.</p>

    <p>Overall those models are far more complex and also include many more indicators describing Economic Growth and Development, Land use, Electricity and heat, Refining, Energy demand, Resource extraction and trade and Climate and non-climate environmental change.</p>

    <p>However, there are also key differnces in what indicators the five marker scenarios IMAGE, MESSAGE-GLOBIUM, AIM/CGE, GCAM4 and REMIND-MAGPIE cover. That&rsquo;s actually the reason for having marker scenarios: For example some models are better equipped to model high regional inequality as requiered for SSP4-Scenarios.</p>

    <p>Feeding scenario assumptions into models will get us scenarios – a set of output variables describing the futures. Let&rsquo;s take a look how some of these variables play out in different scenarios.</p>

    <p>Assumptions on population growth and GDP are already part of the scenario assumptions. This shows us how they turn out over time and in numbers. As you can see the SSP3 scenario of regional rivalary leads us to continued population growth but relatively low growth in GDP. SSP1 (Sustainability) and SSP5 (Fossil-fueled developement) show similar patterns in population growth, but vast differences when it comes to GDP.</p>

    <p>The high GDP of SSP5 comes at a cost: High energy needs and with that lots of CO2-emissions. Until now we only looked at SSP-Baseline Scenarios. Let&rsquo;s set emission goals and include RCPs.</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s means introducing a carbon price. The height of which of course depends on the former emissions and our goal.</p>

    <p>Compared to the Baseline-Scenarios this results in similar final energy but less emissions.</p>

    <h3 id="climate-models">Climate Models</h3>

    <p>Climate models take us from emissions to things like temperature and precipitation. As with IAMs they describe a complex system,  in this case the earth. Climate models are therefore sometimes also related to as Earth System Models. In contrast to weather models they focus on long term changes whereas spatial and temporal resolution is less important.</p>

    <p>This shows the change in average surface temperature from 1986-2005 to 2081-2100 for two different emission scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5.</p>

    <h3 id="climate-impact-models">Climate Impact Models</h3>

    <p>Climate impacts are consequences and effects of climate change on nature and society. These may include changed agricultural yields, increased flooding and droughts, and coral reef bleaching due to changes in the chemical composition of the ocean. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) plays an important role in climate-impact research and covers currently 13 sectors.</p>

    <p>Agriculture: …</p>

    <p>Biodiversity: …</p>

    <p>Biomes: …</p>

    <p>Coastal Infrastructure: …</p>

    <p>Energy: …</p>

    <p>Forestry: …</p>

    <p>Health: …</p>

    <p>Lakes: …</p>

    <p>Marine Fishery: …</p>

    <p>Permafrost: …</p>

    <p>Tropical Cyclones: …</p>

    <p>Water (global): …</p>

    <p>Water (regional): …</p>

    <p>Of course there is a strong link between those sectors and changes in climate, but for some of them changing socioeconomic factors also play an important role. That&rsquo;s why the SSP-RCP Framework is also used here. However, climate impact scenarios generally don&rsquo;t cover the whole bandwith of the SSP-RCP framework. Most of them refer to SSP2 and either RCP 2.6 or RCP 6.0.</p>

    <p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at how these two scenarios play out for different variables.</p>

    <p>As you might have expected, the SSP2-RCP6.0 scenarios show us more extreme impacts.</p>
