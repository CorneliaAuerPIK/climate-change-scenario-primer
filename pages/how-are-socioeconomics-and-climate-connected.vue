    <h2>How are Socioeconomics and Climate connected?</h2>

    <p>Climate change is closely connected to socioeconomics. We humans are the main driver of climate change and we are the ones who can act to mitigate climate change. Of course climate change also affects us. Severe weather events and rising sea levels will change the way we live. Let's take a closer look at the cycle below, to understand this relationship.</p>

    <LayoutScrollify vis="VisCycle">
      <div>
        <p>In <strong class="yellow">socioeconomics</strong> factors like population growth, urbanization, equality, transportation defines the way we live and our land and energy needs.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong class="yellow">Energy and land use</strong> are closely linked to the emissions we produce. Dependent of course of technological advancements and policy changes.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong class="yellow">Emissions</strong> raise the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leads to raising temperatures and changes in precipitation.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Changes in <strong class="yellow">climate</strong> like higher temperatures and changes in precipitation have many side effects, like droughts and sea level raising. These are called climate impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong class="yellow">Climate impacts</strong> will - and already did - influence socioeconomics. In the form of extreme weather events resulting in high infrastructural damage or food crises leading to migration.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Explorative scenarios can be mapped along this cycle. Starting again with <strong class="green">Socioeconomic scenarios</strong>, then <strong class="blue">emission scenarios</strong> and <strong class="red">climate impact scenarios</strong>. Then there are also more specialized scenarios like delayed action scenarios or technology on/off scenarios.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Normatives scenarios also fit in here. <strong class="green">Mitigation scenarios</strong> play a role in socioeconomics and land and energy use. <strong class="red">Adaption scenarios</strong> are closely connected to climate impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>To get from socioeconomics to climate impacts, models come in. The first part - from socioeconomics to emissions is taken care of by <strong class="green">integrated assessment models</strong> (IAMs). Then there are <strong class="violet">climate models</strong> (also known as earth system models - ESMs) and <strong class="red">climate impact models</strong>.</p>
      </div>
    </LayoutScrollify>
    <p>With climate change so dependent of socioeconomic changes, we need to plausible assumptions on our socioeconomic future to create credible scenarios. The SSP-RCP scenario framework, described in detail in the next chapter, offers us those assumptions.</p>
