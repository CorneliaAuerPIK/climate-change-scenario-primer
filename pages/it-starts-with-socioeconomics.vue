    <p>Climate change is closely connected to socioeconomics. We humans are the main driver of climate change and we are the ones who can act to mitigate climate change. Of course climate change also affects us. Severe weather events and rising sea levels will change the way we live. Let's take a closer look at the cycle below, to understand this relationship.</p>

    <LayoutScrollify vis="TestScrollify">
      <div>
        <p>In <strong>socioeconomics</strong> factors like population growth, urbanization, equality, transportation defines the way we live and our land and energy needs.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Energy and land use</strong> are closely linked to the emissions we produce. Dependent of course of technological advancements and policy changes.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Emissions</strong> raise the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leads to raising temperatures and changes in precipitation.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Changes in <strong>climate</strong> like higher temperatures and changes in precipitation have many side effects, like droughts and sea level raising. These are called climate impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Climate impacts</strong> will - and already did - influence socioeconomics. In the form of extreme weather events resulting in high infrastructural damage or food crises leading to migration.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Explorative scenarios can be mapped along this cycle. Starting again with <strong>Socioeconomic scenarios</strong>, then <strong>emission scenarios</strong> and <strong>climate impact scenarios</strong>. Then there are also more specialized scenarios like delayed action scenarios or technology on/off scenarios.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Normatives scenarios also fit in here. <strong>Mitigation scenarios</strong> play a role in socioeconomics and land and energy use. <strong>Adaption scenarios</strong> are closely connected to climate impacts.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>To get from socioeconomics to climate impacts, models come in. The first part - from socioeconomics to emissions is taken care of by <strong>integrated assessment models</strong> (IAMs). Then there are <strong>climate models</strong> (also known as earth system models - ESMs) and <strong>climate impact models</strong>.</p>
      </div>
    </LayoutScrollify>
    <p>With climate change so dependent of socioeconomic changes, we need to plausible assumptions on our socioeconomic future to create credible scenarios. The SSP-RCP scenario framework, described in detail in the next chapter, offers us those assumptions.</p>
