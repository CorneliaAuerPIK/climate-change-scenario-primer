    <h2>Recap</h2>
    <p>Climate change scenarios are a powerful tool for decision making in the context of climate change.</p>
    <p>Socioeconomics and climate change are inseparably intertwined. Socioeconomics define for example our land and energy needs, which are closely linked to emissions. Increased emissions lead to higher GHG concentrations, which leads to climate change and its impacts. Climate impacts close the cycle as they will also influence our socioeconomics.</p>

    <p>To create climate change scenarios we need assumptions about the future and models which represent the relations in the cycle.</p>

    <p>On the model side <strong>integrated assessment models</strong> get us from those socioeconomic assumptions to energy, land use and emissions. <strong>Climate models</strong> take the next step towards future climate. And <strong>climate impact models</strong> show us how that effects nature and society.</p>
