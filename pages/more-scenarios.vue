    <p>As mentionend in the beginning, the world of climate change scenarios cover more than SSP-RCP Scenarios. For example technology-on-off scenarios show implications of new technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and delayed action scenarios allow us to explore implications of delaying climate change policies. On the regional level scenarios let us evaluate specific mitigation and aadaptation strategies.</p>

    <p>Locating these scenarios in the SSP-RCP space helps understanding and comparing them and can be done in two ways. Either top-down by using the same scenario assumptions and - depending on the scenario type - also SSP-RCP scenario data as the basis. Or bottom-up by comparing scenario outcomes.</p>
