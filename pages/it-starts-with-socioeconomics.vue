    <p>Socioeconomics are the main driver of climate change. The number of people on our planet and the way we live determines our land and energy needs.</p>

    <p>Energy and land use are closely linked to the emissions we produce. Dependent of course of technological advancements and policy changes.</p>

    <p>Emissions raise the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leads to raising temperatures and changes in precipitation.</p>

    <p>Higher temperatures and changes in precipitation have many side effects, like droughts and sea level raising. These are called climate impacts.</p>

    <p>Climate impacts will - and already did - influence socioeconomics. In the form of extreme weather events resulting in high infrastructural damage or food crises leading to migration.</p>

    <p>Explorative scenarios can be mapped along this cycle. Starting again with Socioeconomic scenarios, then emission scenarios and climate impact scenarios. Then there are also more specialized scenarios like delayed action scenarios or technology on/off scenarios.</p>

    <p>Normatives scenarios also fit in here. Mitigation scenarios play a role in socioeconomics and land and energy use. Adaption is closely connected to climate impacts.</p>

    <p>To get from socioeconomics to climate impacts, models come in. The first part - from socioeconomics to emissions is taken care of by integrated assessment models (IAMs). Then there are climate models (also known as earth system models - ESMs) and climate impact models.</p>
